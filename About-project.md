*Synopsis of the Simple Quiz Application*
Project Title: Simple Quiz Application in Python (using Tkinter)
Purpose of the Project:
The Simple Quiz Application is a fun and easy-to-use quiz tool built with Python and Tkinter. It’s designed to test your knowledge on different topics through multiple-choice questions. 
The main goal of this project is to:
* Let users answer questions in a simple, interactive way.
* Show users their score at the end of the quiz.
* Allow users to move through the quiz one question at a time.
Features:
Question Display:
*Each question comes with four multiple-choice options.
*Users can click on the options to select their answer
  
Navigation:
* After answering a question, users can click a “Next” button to move to the next question.
* The app automatically goes to the next question after an answer is selected.
  
Answer Checking:
* Once a user selects an answer, the app checks if it's correct and updates their score.
* The score increases by one point for every correct answer.
  
Score Tracking:
* The app keeps track of how many correct answers the user gets.
* At the end of the quiz, the user sees their final score (how many they got right out of the total number of questions).
  
  Outcomes:
  1. Users can see their score right after the quiz finishes.
  2. It’s a great learning tool for those who want to practice Python programming, especially for beginners who want to learn how to build simple GUI applications with Tkinter.
  3. The project emphasizes creating a simple, clean user interface. This is an important skill in software development.
